# storm-the-house-ai
A short program I want to write in order to play Storm The House (and break it). 

Already done by Code Bullet (on youtube), but I would like to replicate it.

# Basic Task List
- Find the game window (or hard-code coordinates for the window)
- Track enemies on the map
- Shoot enemies until they are dead, and before they can damage the fortress
- Reload when magazine is empty
- (Optional) Auto-buy upgrades at the end of the wave (magazine upgrades and sniper rifle only)
